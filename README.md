# 👋 Hey there! I'm Gustavo

🧱 I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with the soul and training of an **Architect** — building digital solutions with the same care, structure, and attention to detail that go into great architecture.

🎓 I hold a professional degree in Architecture from the **National University of Córdoba**, where I learned to think in systems, design with intention, and build things that last. Today, I bring that mindset into the world of code — from backend logic to frontend experiences.

I approach software the way I approached every construction project:  
👉 With a plan, a foundation, and a clear vision — **brick by brick**, feature by feature.
